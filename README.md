🩺 medAssist: Virtual First Aid Assistant
medAssist is a smart, AI-powered virtual assistant built to address critical gaps in emergency healthcare response. By providing real-time first aid guidance, severity assessment, and instant emergency support, medAssist aims to save lives — especially in regions with limited access to healthcare facilities.

Slow response times, inadequate first aid training, emergency room overcrowding, inefficient communication during emergencies, and limited healthcare access in remote areas significantly contribute to increased mortality rates.
